    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Rajma chawal is a popular North Indian dish that consists of red kidney beans (rajma) 
        cooked in a spicy tomato-based gravy, served with rice (chawal). The kidney beans are 
        typically soaked in water overnight, then cooked until they are tender and bursting with flavor. 
        The gravy is made by sautéing onions, garlic, and ginger, and then adding tomatoes, spices, and 
        water to create a thick and flavorful sauce. The cooked beans are then added to the gravy and 
        simmered for a few minutes. The dish is often garnished with fresh cilantro and served with 
        a dollop of butter on top. It is a delicious and comforting meal that is enjoyed by many 
        people in India and around the world.
