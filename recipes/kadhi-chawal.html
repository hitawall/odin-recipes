    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Kadhi chawal is a popular dish in Indian cuisine that 
        consists of a lentil and yogurt-based curry called 
        kadhi, served with rice. The kadhi is made by simmering 
        yogurt, gram flour, and spices in water until it thickens 
        into a creamy consistency. The rice is typically cooked separately 
        and then served with the kadhi on top. Kadhi chawal is often 
        garnished with fried onions and served with pickles or other 
        accompaniments on the side. It is a delicious and satisfying 
        meal that is enjoyed by many people in India and around the world.
